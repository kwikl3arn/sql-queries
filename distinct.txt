Select distinct/UNIQUE but return all columns(SELECT DISTINCT field1, * from table)?
If your table was not that large, and assuming your primary key was an auto-incrementing integer you could do something like this:

SELECT 
  table.*
FROM table
--be able to take out dupes later
LEFT JOIN (
  SELECT field, MAX(id) as id
  FROM table
  GROUP BY field
) as noDupes on noDupes.id = table.id
WHERE
  //this will result in only the last instance being seen
  noDupes.id is not NULL
